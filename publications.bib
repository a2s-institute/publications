	abstract = {In the RoboCup@Work competition, the Rotating Table Test problem refers to the task of automatically grasping an object from a circular table, rotating at constant angular velocity. This task requires the robot to track the target object's position and grasp it. In this work, we propose an online tracking system which works in real-time to track objects in the given task. Our approach is based on the YOLOv5 detection backbone and uses a modified version of the SORT tracker. The used tracker is trained solely on a pre-existing detection dataset containing annotated static images, thanks to which the collection of video data is not required. We evaluate and compare SORT with YOLOv5 and SqueezeDet backbones and show the improvement in tracking performance when using the former.}

	abstract = {Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder find robots easier to communicate with than humans. Thus, robots have been introduced in autism therapies. However, due to the environmental complexity, the used robots often have to be controlled manually. This is a significant drawback of such systems and it is required to make them more autonomous. In particular, the robot should interpret the child's state and continuously adapt its actions according to the behaviour of the child under therapy. This survey elaborates on different forms of personalized robot behaviour models. Various approaches from the field of Human-Robot Interaction, as well as Child- Robot Interaction, are discussed. The aim is to compare them in terms of their deficits, feasibility in real scenarios, and potential usability for autism-specific Robot-Assisted Therapy. The general challenge for algorithms based on which the robot learns proper interaction strategies during therapeutic games is to increase the robot's autonomy, thereby providing a basis for a robot's decision-making.},

The solution for this problem is to increase the level of autonomy of the system, namely the robot should interpret and adapt to the behaviour of the child under therapy. The problem that we are adressing is to develop a behaviour model that will be used for the robot decision-making process, which will learn how to adequately react to certain child reactions.

One of the reasons is different sampling rates and dimensions of different modalities. In this paper, we use multimodal data fusion techniques such as early, late and intermediate fusion for grasp failure identification using four different 3D convolution-based multimodal neural networks (3D-MNN). Our results on a visual-tactile dataset shows that the performance of the classification task is improved while using multimodal data. In addition, a neural network trained with 30:22 train-test split of multimodal data achieved accuracy comparable to a network trained with 78:22 train-test split of unimodal data.},

	abstract = {For executing actions, robots need reliable continuous policy models that are able to process complex sensory information in order to generate appropriate execution parameters. At the same time, robots should have some level of understanding of their decision-making process, as this contributes towards their explainability and, as a result, increases their trustworthiness in applications where they co-exist with humans -- particularly when they experience execution failures. These requirements can be satisfied by hybrid models, which combine semantic and continuous execution models into a common representation. In this paper, we shortly summarise our learning-based hybrid representation of action execution knowledge and some extensions thereof, such that we particularly discuss how the representation can be embedded into a framework for generalising actions over objects and how it can be utilised for diagnosing certain types of execution failures.},

  abstract = {Machine learning and neural networks are now ubiquitous in sonar perception, but it lags behind the computer vision field due to the lack of data and pre-trained models specifically for sonar images. In this paper we present the Marine Debris Turntable dataset and produce pre-trained neural networks trained on this dataset, meant to fill the gap of missing pre-trained models for sonar images. We train Resnet 20, MobileNets, DenseNet121, SqueezeNet, MiniXception, and an Autoencoder, over several input image sizes, from 32 x 32 to 96 x 96, on the Marine Debris turntable dataset. We evaluate these models using transfer learning for low-shot classification in the Marine Debris Watertank and another dataset captured using a Gemini 720i sonar. Our results show that in both datasets the pre-trained models produce good features that allow good classification accuracy with low samples (10-30 samples per class). The Gemini dataset validates that the features transfer to other kinds of sonar sensors. We expect that the community benefits from the public release of our pre-trained models and the turntable dataset.}

	abstract = {An important prerequisite for the reliability and robustness of a service robot is ensuring the robot's correct behavior when it performs various tasks of interest. Extensive testing is one established approach for ensuring behavioural correctness; this becomes even more important with the integration of learning-based methods into robot software architectures, as there are often no theoretical guarantees about the performance of such methods in varying scenarios. In this paper, we aim towards evaluating the correctness of robot behaviors in tabletop manipulation through automatic generation of simulated test scenarios in which a robot assesses its performance using property-based testing. In particular, key properties of interest for various robot actions are encoded in an action ontology and are then verified and validated within a simulated environment. We evaluate our framework with a Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR) which is tested in a Gazebo simulation. We show that our framework can correctly and consistently identify various failed actions in a variety of randomised tabletop manipulation scenarios, in addition to providing deeper insights into the type and location of failures for each designed property.},

	abstract = {Execution monitoring is essential for robots to detect and respond to failures. Since it is impossible to enumerate all failures for a given task, we learn from successful executions of the task to detect visual anomalies during runtime. Our method learns to predict the motions that occur during the nominal execution of a task, including camera and robot body motion. A probabilistic U-Net architecture is used to learn to predict optical flow, and the robot's kinematics and 3D model are used to model camera and body motion. The errors between the observed and predicted motion are used to calculate an anomaly score. We evaluate our method on a dataset of the robot placing a book on a shelf, which includes anomalies such as falling books, camera occlusions, and robot disturbances. We find that modeling camera and body motion, in addition to the learning-based optical flow prediction, results in an improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.752 to 0.804, and the area under the precision-recall curve from 0.467 to 0.549.},

	abstract = {When an autonomous robot learns how to execute actions, it is of interest to know if and when the execution policy can be generalised to variations of the learning scenarios. This can inform the robot about the necessity of additional learning, as using incomplete or unsuitable policies can lead to execution failures. Generalisation is particularly relevant when a robot has to deal with a large variety of objects and in different contexts. In this paper, we propose and analyse a strategy for generalising parameterised execution models of manipulation actions over different objects based on an object ontology. In particular, a robot transfers a known execution model to objects of related classes according to the ontology, but only if there is no other evidence that the model may be unsuitable. This allows using ontological knowledge as prior information that is then refined by the robot's own experiences. We verify our algorithm for two actions - grasping and stowing everyday objects - such that we show that the robot can deduce cases in which an existing policy can generalise to other objects and when additional execution knowledge has to be acquired.},

	abstract = {Domestic service robots are becoming more ubiquitous and can perform various assistive tasks such as fetching items or helping with medicine intake to support humans with impairments of varying severity. However, the development of robots taking care of humans should not only be focused on developing advanced functionalities, but should also be accompanied by the definition of benchmarking protocols enabling the rigorous and reproducible evaluation of robots and their functionalities. Thereby, of particular importance is the assessment of robots' ability to deal with failures and unexpected events which occur when they interact with humans in real-world scenarios. For example, a person might drop an object during a robot-human hand over due to its weight. However, the systematic investigation of hazardous situations remains challenging as (i) failures are difficult to reproduce; and (ii) possibly impact the health of humans. Therefore, we propose in this paper to employ the concept of scientific robotic competitions as a benchmarking protocol for assessing care robots and to collect datasets of human-robot interactions covering a large variety of failures which are present in real-world domestic environments. We demonstrate the process of defining the benchmarking procedure with the human-to-robot and robot-to-human handover functionalities, and execute a dry-run of the benchmarks while inducing several failure modes such as dropping objects, ignoring the robot, and not releasing objects. A dataset comprising colour and depth images, a wrist force-torque sensor and other internal sensors of the robot was collected during the dry-run. In addition, we discuss the relation between benchmarking protocols and standards that exist or need to be extended with regard to the test procedures required for verifying and validating conformance to standards.},

	abstract = {Assembling robotic multi-agent systems is becoming increasingly attractive due to the emergence of affordable robots. For coordinated missions such fleets usually have to communicate over unreliable channels and still achieve adequate performance. To support system designers in quantifying adequateness, in this paper we present a domain specific language (DSL) that allows domain-experts to specify (i) quality of service (QoS) requirements of the communication channels; and (ii) QoS capabilities of the involved software components. Such QoS specifications complement the QoS management that has recently been introduced into ROS 2. To fully utilize this approach we have also developed an associated ROS 2 DSL which enables us to verify QoS specifications and provide feedback to the users already at design time. We have evaluated the developed language workbench following the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach which demonstrates that the QoS DSL is complete with respect to ROS 2 and can be easily extended. Additionally, we generate a proof-of-concept implementation for a QoS monitor that can be seamlessly integrated into existing ROS 2 projects.},

	abstract = {When faced with an execution failure, an intelligent robot should be able to identify the likely reasons for the failure and adapt its execution policy accordingly. This paper addresses the question of how to utilise knowledge about the execution process, expressed in terms of learned constraints, in order to direct the diagnosis and experience acquisition process. In particular, we present two methods for creating a synergy between failure diagnosis and execution model learning. We first propose a method for diagnosing execution failures of parameterised action execution models, which searches for action parameters that violate a learned precondition model. We then develop a strategy that uses the results of the diagnosis process for generating synthetic data that are more likely to lead to successful execution, thereby increasing the set of available experiences to learn from. The diagnosis and experience correction methods are evaluated for the problem of handle grasping, such that we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the diagnosis algorithm and show that corrected failed experiences can contribute towards improving the execution success of a robot.},

	abstract = {When a robotic agent experiences a failure while acting in the world, it should be possible to discover why that failure has occurred, namely to diagnose the failure. In this paper, we argue that the diagnosability of robot actions, at least in a classical sense, is a feature that cannot be taken for granted since it strongly depends on the underlying action representation. We specifically define criteria that determine the diagnosability of robot actions. The diagnosability question is then analysed in the context of a handle manipulation action, such that we discuss two different representations of the action - a composite policy with a learned success model for the action parameters, and a neural network-based monolithic policy - both of which exist on different sides of the diagnosability spectrum. Through this comparison, we conclude that composite actions are more suited to explicit diagnosis, but representations with less prior knowledge are more flexible. This suggests that model learning may provide balance between flexibility and diagnosability; however, data-driven diagnosis methods also need to be enhanced in order to deal with the complexity of modern robots.},

Still, nowadays, those skills are hand-crafted by experts which frequently requires labor-intensive, manual parameter tuning. Moreover, some tasks are too complex to be specified fully using a task specification. Learning these skills, by contrast, requires a high number of costly and potentially unsafe interactions with the environment. We present a compliant manipulation approach using reinforcement learning guided by the Task Frame Formalism, a task specification method. This allows us to specify the easy to model knowledge about a task while the robot learns the unmodeled components by reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we describe and analyse a representation of execution-specific knowledge that combines (i) a relational model in the form of qualitative attributes that describe the conditions under which actions can be executed successfully and (ii) a continuous model in the form of a Gaussian process that can be used for generating parameters for action execution, but also for evaluating the expected execution success given a particular action parameterisation. The proposed representation is based on prior, modelled knowledge about actions and is combined with a learning process that is supervised by a teacher. We analyse the benefits of this representation in the context of two actions - grasping handles and pulling an object on a table - such that the experiments demonstrate that the joint relational-continuous model allows a robot to improve its execution based on experience, while reducing the severity of failures experienced during execution.},

In this work, we propose an \textit{apprenticeship learning} approach to achieving context-aware action generalization on the task of robot-to-human object hand-over. The procedure combines learning from demonstration and reinforcement learning: a robot first imitates a demonstrator's execution of the task and then learns contextualized variants of the demonstrated action through experience. We use dynamic movement primitives as compact motion representations, and a model-based C-REPS algorithm for learning policies that can specify hand-over position, conditioned on context variables. Policies are learned using simulated task executions, before transferring them to the robot and evaluating emergent behaviours. We additionally conduct a user study involving participants assuming different postures and receiving an object from a robot, which executes hand-overs by either imitating a demonstrated motion, or adapting its motion to hand-over positions suggested by the learned policy. The results confirm the hypothesized improvements in the robot's perceived behaviour when it is context-aware and adaptive, and provide useful insights that can inform future developments.},

	abstract = {We investigate two major limiting factors in the design and implementation of modern dynamics solvers that interfere with their full utilization in versatile, manipulation-driven robotic software architectures. The first limitation originates from the design of those solvers which aims at computational efficiency while neglecting composability. Instead, we advocate to design the solvers in such a way that they exploit linearity in the equations of motion to fully decompose the state of a kinematic chain. This enables a versatile recomposition and more flexible applications. Secondly, we have observed that most implementations follow the programming principle of information hiding. Consequently, the internal state that is used to compute motion control commands is withheld from other parts of the software architecture. We tackle this problem by following a dataflow programming paradigm and separating the software's dataflow from the control flow. Thereafter, we demonstrate those two simple, yet effective strategies to overcome the limitations along various case studies.},

	abstract = {Stress is necessary for optimal performance and functioning in daily life. However, when stress exceeds person-specific coping levels, then it begins to negatively impact health and productivity. An automatic stress monitoring system that tracks stress levels based on physical and physiological parameters, can assist the user in maintaining stress within healthy limits. In order to build such a system, we need to develop and test various algorithms on a reference dataset consisting of multimodal stress responses. Such a reference dataset should fulfil requirements derived from results and practices of clinical and empirical research. This paper proposes a set of such requirements to support the establishment of a reference dataset for multimodal human stress detection. The requirements cover person-dependent and technical aspects such as selection of sample population, choice of stress stimuli, inclusion of multiple stress modalities, selection of annotation methods, and selection of data acquisition devices. Existing publicly available stress datasets were evaluated based on criteria derived from the proposed requirements. It was found that none of these datasets completely fulfilled the requirements. Therefore, efforts should be made in the future to establish a reference dataset, satisfying the specified requirements, in order to ensure comparability and reliability of results.},

We developed an optical flow-based method for tracking treadmill ball motion in real time using a single high-resolution camera. Tracking accuracy and timing were determined using calibration data. Ball tracking was performed at 500 Hz and integrated with an open source game engine for virtual reality projection. The projection was updated at 120 Hz with a latency with respect to ball motion of 30 $\pm$ 8 ms. The system was tested for behavior with fruit flies. The application and source code are available at https://github.com/ivan-vishniakou/neural-circuits-vr. Optical flow-based tracking of treadmill motion is typically achieved using optical mice. The camera-based optical flow tracking system developed here is based on off-the-shelf components and offers control over the image acquisition and processing parameters. This results in flexibility with respect to tracking conditions -- such as ball surface texture, lighting conditions, or ball size -- as well as camera alignment and calibration. A fast system for rotational ball motion tracking suitable for virtual reality behavior with fruit flies was developed and characterized.},

But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

By greedily following the path of greatest fitness improvement, objective-based search overlooks and discards stepping stones which might be critical to solving the problem. Here, we hypothesize that Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a better way to generate stepping stones than objective-based search: by maintaining a large set of solutions which are of high-quality, but phenotypically different, these algorithms collect promising stepping stones while protecting them in their own "ecological niche". To demonstrate the capabilities of QD we revisit the challenge of recreating images produced by user-driven evolution, a classic challenge which spurred work in novelty search and illustrated the limits of objective-based search. We show that QD far outperforms objective-based search in matching user-evolved images. Further, our results suggest some intriguing possibilities for leveraging the diversity of solutions created by QD.},

	abstract = {Surrogate models are used to reduce the burden of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions in optimization. By creating models which map genomes to objective values, these models can estimate the performance of unknown inputs, and so be used in place of expensive objective functions. Evolutionary techniques such as genetic programming or neuroevolution commonly alter the structure of the genome itself. A lack of consistency in the genotype is a fatal blow to data-driven modeling techniques: interpolation between points is impossible without a common input space. However, while the dimensionality of genotypes may differ across individuals, in many domains, such as controllers or classifiers, the dimensionality of the input and output remains constant. In this work we leverage this insight to embed differing neural networks into the same input space. To judge the difference between the behavior of two neural networks, we give them both the same input sequence, and examine the difference in output. This difference, the phenotypic distance, can then be used to situate these networks into a common input space, allowing us to produce surrogate models which can predict the performance of neural networks regardless of topology. In a robotic navigation task, we show that models trained using this phenotypic embedding perform as well or better as those trained on the weight values of a fixed topology neural network. We establish such phenotypic surrogate models as a promising and flexible approach which enables surrogate modeling even for representations that undergo structural changes.},

In this work, we model Granger causal relationships between pairs of sensor data streams to detect changes in their dependencies. We compare the method on simulated signals with the Pearson correlation, and show that the method elegantly handles noise and lags in the signals and provides appreciable dependency detection. We further evaluate the method using sensor data from a mobile robot by injecting both internal and external faults during operation of the robot. The results show that the method is able to detect changes in the system when faults are injected, but is also prone to detecting false positives. This suggests that this method can be used as a weak detection of faults, but other methods, such as the use of a structural model, are required to reliably detect and diagnose faults.},

We then present an extensive set of experiments in which our robot was grasping various everyday objects in a domestic environment, where a sequence of object detection, pose estimation, and manipulation was required for successfully completing the task. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed whole body motion framework for everyday object manipulation, but also illustrate the necessity for highly adaptive manipulation strategies that make better use of a robot's perceptual capabilities.},

In order to make this process more automatic and intuitive for the end-user, this paper presents a novel approach to determine a close-optimal workpiece pose for different robotic manufacturing processes like welding and milling. The approach is based on a model-based interpretation of the Product, Process, and Resource (PPR) components defined in an internally developed Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. After the interpretation addressed to simplify the path planning, an algorithm uses sample-based motion planning techniques and optimization algorithms, in order to find optimal motions in reaction to infeasible states of the robot (i.e. maximum joint limits and reachability) and a close-optimal workpiece pose. The optimized path planning is achieved by exploring an interpreted Configuration Space (C-space) using a Degree of Freedom (DoF) of the Robot Manufacturing Processes (RMP) and by interpreting its constraints. Simulation results are presented for robotic welding and milling task by optimizing welding orientations and robot stiffness respectively in the path planning and the joint movements and gravity cost criteria in the workpiece positioning. Optimization of these criteria could be used in RMP to address improvement of the process quality.},

Neuroevolution, however, has so far resisted the application of these techniques because it requires the surrogate model to make fitness predictions based on variable topologies, instead of a vector of parameters. Our main insight is that we can sidestep this problem by using kernel-based surrogate models, which require only the definition of a distance measure between individuals. Our second insight is that the well-established Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm provides a computationally efficient distance measure between dissimilar networks in the form of "compatibility distance", initially designed to maintain topological diversity. Combining these two ideas, we introduce a surrogate-assisted neuroevolution algorithm that combines NEAT and a surrogate model built using a compatibility distance kernel. We demonstrate the data-efficiency of this new algorithm on the low dimensional cart-pole swing-up problem, as well as the higher dimensional half-cheetah running task. In both tasks the surrogate-assisted variant achieves the same or better results with several times fewer function evaluations as the original NEAT.},

In these domains illumination algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are promising alternatives to classic optimization algorithms because they produce diverse, high-quality solutions in a single run, instead of only a single near-optimal solution. Unfortunately, these algorithms currently require a large number of function evaluations, limiting their applicability. In this article, we introduce a new illumination algorithm, Surrogate-Assisted Illumination SAIL, that leverages surrogate modeling techniques to create a map of the design space according to user-defined features while minimizing the number of fitness evaluations. On a two-dimensional airfoil optimization problem, SAIL produces hundreds of diverse but high-performing designs with several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations than MAP-Elites or CMA-ES. We demonstrate that SAIL is also capable of producing maps of high-performing designs in realistic three-dimensional aerodynamic tasks with an accurate flow simulation. Data-efficient design exploration with SAIL can help designers understand what is possible, beyond what is optimal, by considering more than pure objective-based optimization.},

For this, it is crucial for robot developers to consider fault diagnosis. In this study, a general non-intrusive fault diagnosis system for robotic platforms is proposed. A mini-PC is non-intrusively attached to a robot that is used to detect and diagnose faults. The health data and diagnosis produced by the mini-PC is then standardized and transmitted to a remote-PC. A storage device is also attached to the mini-PC for data logging of health data in case of loss of communication with the remote-PC. In this study, a hybrid fault diagnosis method is compared to consistency-based diagnosis (CBD), and CBD is selected to be deployed on the system. The proposed system is modular and can be deployed on different robotic platforms with minimum setup.},

This technique to 'illuminate' the problem space through the lens of chosen features has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring design spaces, but is limited by the need for numerous evaluations. The Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL) algorithm, introduced here, integrates approximative models and intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of evaluations required by MAP-Elites. The ability of SAIL to efficiently produce both accurate models and diverse high-performing solutions is illustrated on a 2D airfoil design problem. The search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a different combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations. The CMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin.},

Inspired by robotics techniques designed to produce diverse repertoires of behaviors for use in damage recovery, SAIL produces diverse designs that vary according to features specified by the designer. By producing high-performing designs with varied combinations of user-defined features a map of the design space is created. This map illuminates the relationship between the chosen features and performance, and can aid designers in identifying promising design concepts. SAIL is designed for use with compu-tationally expensive design problems, such as fluid or structural dynamics, and integrates approximative models and intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of function evaluations required. On a 2D airfoil optimization problem SAIL is shown to produce hundreds of diverse designs which perform competitively with those found by state-of-the-art black box optimization. Its capabilities are further illustrated in a more expensive 3D aerodynamic optimization task.},

A promising approach for teaching robots a certain behavior is Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which estimates the underlying reward function of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from observed behavior of an expert. Recently, an approach called Simultaneous Estimation of Rewards and Dynamics (SERD) has been proposed, which extends IRL by simultaneously estimating the dynamics. The objective of this work is to compare classical IRL algorithms with SERD for learning high level navigation strategies in a realistic hallway navigation scenario solely from human expert demonstrations. We show that the theoretical advantages of SERD also pay off in practice by estimating better models of the dynamics and explaining the expert's demonstrations more accurately.},

The possibility of encountering such faults can be minimised if symbolic and geometric precondition models are combined into a representation that specifies how and where actions should be executed. This work investigates the problem of learning such action execution models and the manner in which those models can be generalised. In particular, we develop a template-based representation of execution models, which we call $\delta$ models, and describe how symbolic template representations and geometric success probability distributions can be combined for generalising the templates beyond the problem instances on which they are created. Our experimental analysis, which is performed with two physical robot platforms, shows that $\delta$ models can describe execution-specific knowledge reliably, thus serving as a viable model for avoiding the occurrence of external faults.},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots comprise of several hardware and software components. These components interact with each other continuously in order to achieve autonomity. Due to the complexity of such a task, a monumental responsibility is bestowed upon the developer to make sure that the robot is always operable. Hence, some means of detecting faults should be readily available. In this work, the aforementioned fault-detection system is a robotic black box (RBB) attached to the robot which acquires all the relevant measurements of the system that are needed to achieve a fault-free robot. Due to limited computational and memory resources on-board the RBB, a distributed diagnosis is proposed. That is, the fault diagnosis task (detection and isolation) is shared among an on-board component (the black box) and an off-board component (an external computer). The distribution of the diagnosis task allows for a non-intrusive method of detecting and diagnosing faults, in addition to the ability of remotely diagnosing a robot and potentially issuing a repair command. In addition to decomposing the diagnosis task and allowing remote diagnosability of the robot, another key feature of this work is the addition of expert human knowledge to aid in the fault detection process.},

Most previous work in text detection considers only a single script, usually Latin, and it is not able to detect text with multiple scripts. Our contribution combines an established technique -Maximum Stable Extremal Regions-with a histogram of stroke width (HSW) feature and a Support Vector Machine classifier. We combined characters into groups by raycasting and merged aligned groups into lines of text that can also be verified by using the HSW. We evaluated our detection pipeline on our own dataset of road scenes from Autobahn (German Highways), and show how the character classifier stage can be trained with one script and be successfully tested on a different one. While precision and recall match to state of the art solution. A unique characteristic of the HSW feature is that it can learn and detect multiple scripts, which we believe can yield script independence.},

Correctly identifying and handling faults is an inherent characteristic that all autonomous mobile agents should possess, as none of the hardware and software parts used by robots are perfect; instead, they are often error-prone and able to introduce serious problems that might endanger both robots and their environment. Based on a study of literature covering model-based fault-diagnosis algorithms, we selected four of these methods based on both linear and non-linear models. We analyzed and implemented them in a mathematical model, representing a kinematics of four-wheel-OMNI mobile robot. Numerical examples were used to test the ability of three of the described algorithms to detect and identify abnormal behavior and to optimise the model parameters for the given training data. The final goal was to point out the strengths of each algorithm and to figure out which method would best suit the demands of fault diagnosis for a particular mobile robot.},

Therefore a localization system can greatly improve location aware applications for users and venue managers, which can obtain statistical information from users behavior by tracking their location over time for marketing or organizational purposes. In this work a positioning solution able to localize the user based on data measured with a mobile device is described and evaluated. The position estimate uses data from smartphone built-in sensors, WiFi (Wireless Fidelity), BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) adapters and map information of the indoor environment (e.g. walls and obstacles). A probability map derived from statistical information of the users tracked location over a period of time in the test scenario is generated and embedded in a map graph, in order to correct and combine the position estimates under a Bayesian representation. PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning), beacon-based Weighted Centroid position estimates, map infor- mation obtained from building OpenStreetMap XML representa- tion and probability map users path density are combined using a Particle Filter and implemented in a smartphone application. Based on evaluations, this work verifies that the use of smartphone hardware components, map data and its semantic in- formation represented in the form of a OpenStreetMap structure provide room accuracy and a scalable indoor positioning solution. The proposed and evaluated deployed beacons distribution (1 beacon per each 100 squared meters area), the Particle Filter algorithm used to combine various sources of information, its radio beacon-based observation, probability particle weighting process and the mapping approach allowing the inclusion of new indoor environments knowledge show a promising approach for an extensible indoor navigation system.},

The sensory elements are optical analog VLSI silicon retina type devices that do on-chip gradient operations and perform a current mode hysteretic winner-take-all function. Each sensor device extracts a characteristic feature from the optical input: position of highest contrast along a 1-D array, maximum speed along a 1-D array, maximum optical flow on a 2-D array. These are continuously calculated by the respective sensory devices. The sensory devices are applied in a mobile robotics application. They are used for active ball control, ball velocity prediction and active gaze-control for RoboCup Middle-Size League robots.},

	abstract = {A way of combining a relatively new sensor-technology, that is optical analog VLSI devices, with a standard digital omni-directional vision system is investigated. The sensor used is a neuromorphic analog VLSI sensor that estimates the global visual image motion. The sensor provides two analog output voltages that represent the components of the global optical flow vector. The readout is guided by an omni-directional mirror that maps the location of the ball and directs the robot to align its position so that a sensor-actuator module that includes the analog VLSI optical flow sensor can be activated. The purpose of the sensoractuator module is to operate with a higher update rate than the standard vision system and thus increase the reactivity of the robot for very specific situations. This paper will demonstrate an application example where the robot is a goalkeeper with the task of defending the goal during a penalty kick.},

Johnny serves as a research and development platform to explore, develop and integrate capabilities required for real-world domestic service applications. We present a control architecture which allows to cope with various and changing domestic service robot tasks. A software architecture supporting the rapid integration of functionality into a complete system is as well presented. Further, we describe novel and robust algorithms centered around multi-modal human robot interaction, semantic scene understanding and SLAM. Evaluation of the complete system has been performed during the last years in the RoboCup@Home competition where Johnnys outstanding performance led to successful participation. The results and lessons learned of these benchmarks are explained in more detail.},

	abstract = {Domestic service robots are designed for human environment. Therefore, the robot should be controlled by means of natural interactions rather than the common controllers used in laboratory setting (e.g. keyboard or joypad). In this paper, a feature for controlling a domestic service robot through physical interaction is presented. The feature showcases the utilization of the robot's manipulator as its haptic interface. The feature uses low pass filter and proportional-integral- derivative (PID) controller which remove the rapid fluctuation in the force input and stabilize the velocity output. The robot's omnidirectional capability is accommodated through different interaction modes which can be selected based on the user preference. Through the proposed approach, the physical interaction will be translated into base motion commands which adjust itself autonomously. The result is a more natural way of controlling the robot. The feature has been proven to be intuitive and safe through the user trial which was performed in a domestic environment.},

But for traffic sign recognition there are still many challenges to be tackled. This contribution presents how research and intelligent development of computer vision algorithms will enable much more advanced traffic sign recognition systems on embedded systems by reducing processing time while simultaneously enlarging functionality.

	abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs) use a recurrent artificial neural network as a reservoir. Finding a good one depends on choosing the right parameters for the generation of the reservoir, intuition and luck. The method proposed in this article eliminates the need for the tuning by hand by replacing it with a double evolutionary computation. First a broad search to find the right parameters which generate the reservoir is used. Then a search directly on the connectivity matrices fine-tunes the ESN. Both steps show improvements over other known methods for an experimental limit-cycle dataset of the Twin-Burger underwater robot.},

It is implemented using a rule-based production system and creates the task goals for autonomous mobile robots. It controls the environment's agency using sensor data from processing stations and instructs proper reactions. The monitoring and collection of various data allows for an effective instrumentation of the competitions for evaluation purposes. The goal is to achieve automated runs with no or as little human intervention as possible which would allow for more and longer lasting runs. It provides a general framework adaptable to suit many scenarios and is an interesting test case for knowledge-based systems in an industry-inspired setting.},

Domain-specific modeling promises an efficient and flexible concept for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. It allows to raise the level of abstraction through the use of specific concepts that are closer to the respective domain concerns and easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, it focuses on increasing the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, to bridge the gap between the modeling and the implementation levels and to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Within this contribution, we survey the literature available on domain-specific (modeling) languages in robotics required to realize a state-of-the-art real-world example from the RoboCup@Work competition. We classify 41 publications in the field as reference for potential DSL users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a DSL-engineering viewpoint and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects such as the methods and tools used for DSL implementation as well as their documentation status and platform integration. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for discussion in the robotics programming and simulation community based on the insights gained with this survey.},

ESNs can be trained orders of magnitude faster than other RNNs and previous simulation-based investigations showed promising results when ESNs where used as black box models in the domain of system identification or as a low-level plant controllers [11]. This paper validates for the first time the predicted superior simulation results by physical experiments. In order to compare the quality of an ESN controller fairly to the original PID based controller a complete test work flow is established. It consists of an embedded implementation of the ESN motor-controller, a trace facility, a procedure to train a new ESN motor-controller according to these traced data and a user interface to define and control test-drives of the robot. The results prove that the ESN controller shows a slightly better control quality as a PID controller with respect to various important error norms from control theory. For the experiments we used a RoboCup robot and for this special application scenario the ESN controller actually outperforms the PID.},

A crucial requirement for these robotic caregivers will be the ability to safely interact with humans, such as firmly grasping a human arm without applying excessive force. Minding this concern, we developed a reactive grasp that, using tactile sensors, monitors the pressure it exerts during manipulation. Our approach, inspired by human manipulation, employs an architecture based on different grasping phases that represent particular stages in a manipulation task. Within these phases, we implemented and composed simple components to interpret and react to the information obtained by the tactile sensors. Empirical results, using a Care-O-bot 3 R with a Schunk Dexterous Hand (SDH-2), show that considering tactile information can reduce the force exerted on the objects significantly.},

The features are extracted from point clouds of a set of objects and used to train an SVM classifier. Various combinations of the proposed features are tested to determine their influence on the recognition rate. Medium-sized objects are recognized with high accuracy whereas small objects have a lower recognition rate.

The approach is evaluated online as well as offline on a set of sequences recorded with a Care-O-bot 3, and compared with a feature-based method for image registration.

This article presents the application of a recent software development technique called eXtreme Programming to the realm of RoboCup. Many common problems typical for teams of students seem to be solvable with this technique. It also gradually spreads out in professional software production companies. Students mastering it are of high use for their further career after having left the university. The strategy is being tested on a real RoboCup Mid-Size and an Aibo league project and produces very promising results. The approach makes it possible to modularize scientific knowledge into software that can be re-used.

In-hand slippage, i.e. a grasped object moving within the robot's grasp, is inherent to many of these tasks and thus, a robot's ability to detect a slippage is vital for executing a manipulation task successfully. In this paper, we develop a slip detection approach which is based on the robot's tactile sensors, a force/torque sensor and a combination thereof. The evaluation of our approach, carried out on the Care-O-bot 3 platform, highly suggests that the actions and motions performed by the robot during grasping should be taken into account during slip detection for improved performance. Based on this insight, we propose an in-hand slip detection architecture that is able to adapt to the current robot's actions at run time.},

The environment information collected by the robot - represented by 2D or 3D images - has to be provided with a high resolution and a low delay to ensure a fast and precise system response. But in most realistic applications, the communication parameters fluctuate strongly over time. It is necessary to monitor the communication link continuously to react in case of reduced bandwidth and increased delay. But which environment information and correspondingly which bandwidth is necessary to control a robot safely? Due to a missing reliable rule set we investigated this question for a UAV scenario based on two different environment representations (camera images, gridmaps). We designed a simulator based study and evaluated the capability of the participants to control a robot in case of delayed or coarsely rasterized information. Although our study involved only non-experts, we found some interesting first results. While the performance of our participants depends strongly on the delay, it is nearly independent on the image resolution, which suggests downsampling as a valid response for bandwidth decrease. We also found that participants generally struggle with using grid map for controlling the robot. However, this type of interfaces requires far less bandwidth than images. They also excel in situations with higher delays, which makes them the tool of choice when there are really bad channel conditions.},

Those possibilities are called design alternatives and differ on many different aspects, one being preferred to the other depending on how, where, when or what the application should do. Design Space Exploration (DSE) is the process of reviewing those design alternatives, prior to their implementation, with intention to verify that the set of all design alternatives to be implemented covers all the possible scenarios in which the application is to be executed. In this paper we address two challenges related to DSE, namely, (1) the formal definitions of design spaces, a non-trivial task due to the many dimensions to be taken into consideration, and (2) the automatisation of DSE, that is, enabling a domain expert to review design alternatives corresponding to a given design space effortlessly. In this paper, we address those challenges in the context of robot perception software systems by combining two already existing technologies, namely RPSL for the specification of robot perception system's design spaces and Lightning, a language workbench that we use to formalise RPSL and obtain, from RPSL specifications, corresponding design alternatives.},

To capture this knowledge explicitly and formally in the form of various domain models, roboticists have recently employed model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. However, these models are merely seen as a way to support humans during the robot's software design process. We argue that the robots themselves should be first-class consumers of this knowledge to autonomously adapt their software to the various and changing run-time requirements induced, for instance, by the robot's tasks or environment. Motivated by knowledge-enabled approaches, we address this problem by employing a graph-based knowledge representation that allows us not only to persistently store domain models, but also to formulate powerful queries for the sake of run time adaptation. We have evaluated our approach in an integrated, real-world system using the neo4j graph database and we report some lessons learned. Further, we show that the graph database imposes only little overhead on the system's overall performance.},

This integrated system enables us to perform non-interfering measurements of even minor deformations in the flexible fingers and consequently deduce information about grasped objects without the need of advanced fabrication methods. Our experiments have demonstrated that the sensor is capable of robustly detecting grasps on most test objects with an accuracy of 100% without false positives by relying on simple, yet powerful signal processing and can detect deformations of less than 0.03 mm. In addition, the sensor detects objects that are slipping through the flexible fingers.},

The objective is to move the manipulator under the influence of a plenitude of constraints, mainly following the human operator's commands, but also the avoidance of adverse effects such as joint limits or the exertion of external forces. A classic approach to incorporate such non-instantaneous behavior into the instantaneous motion of the kinematic chain is the Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics (CLIK) control scheme.

In this paper, we present PV-CLIK, a novel CLIK realization that for the first time practically applies the Popov-Vereshchagin (PV) hybrid dynamics solver to map the instantaneous constraints to motion commands. By relying on the PV solver, PV-CLIK offers several benefits over traditional CLIK implementations such as linear runtime complexity, handling constraints on the dynamics level or fostering composable software architectures. In the experimental evaluation, we show that our implementation of PV-CLIK outperforms existing kinematics solvers in Cartesian trajectory-following tasks at high velocities.},

However, all too often roboticists treat it as a singular event that can be solved with elaborate prior information such as kinematic models and planning thereupon. Instead, we advocate the view of grasping as a process that requires continuous adaptation to handle cases like (i) uncertainty in the objects' shape or mass that may result in imperfect grasps; or (ii) objects slipping in the robot's fingers. Recently, compliant fingers have been employed to address those challenges. However, it is still an open question how to properly integrate sensors to estimate the fingers' grasping state.

We propose the integration of low-cost -- in terms of monetary expenses and integration effort -- bend sensors and proximity sensors into a pair of flexible fingers. The resulting system enables the robot to detect and react to object slippage by relying on a simple sensor fusion scheme. We successfully demonstrate those capabilities over a set of objects that feature varying characteristics in terms of geometric shape, mass or rigidity. Two specially challenging objects are a fragile chocolate egg and a key chain that the robot still handles successfully.},
